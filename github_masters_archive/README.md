This repo is a portion of Gareth David Hunt's Master's work, archived for future reference.  It contains the gridworld the experiments were performed on, our risk sensitive reinforcement learner (split into two parts - our\_learner.py which contains the actual learning algorithm and our\_system.py which runs the learner on the gridworld as well as collecting the data needed to generate heatmaps and analytics) and a visualiser to show our gridworld, heatmaps on our gridworld, etc.
