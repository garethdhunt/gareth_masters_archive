This repo is a portion of Gareth David Hunt's Master's work, archived for future reference.  It contains the gridworld the experiments were performed on, our risk sensitive reinforcement learner and a visualiser to show our gridworld, heatmaps on our gridworld and a Q-learner than also runs on the gridworld.
